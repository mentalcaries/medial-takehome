**What it does:**

- View all existing tasks
- See the details of each task, with badges and icons to indicate their priority and status
- Add new tasks
- Edit tasks and re-assign to other users 
- Delete tasks (with a confirmation modal)
- Pagination and sorting of tasks


## Requirements
- [x] Create a React application using Create React App/NextJS.
- [x] Use TypeScript for type safety.
- [x] Use Material UI for the UI components (the default MUI styling should be okay).
- [x] Implement a form to create new tasks with the following fields:
    - [x] Title (string)
    - [x] Description (string)
    - [x] Due Date (date)
    - [x] Assignee (string)
    - [x] Priority Level (select: low, medium, high)
    - [x] Notes (string)
    - [x] Status (select: pending, in progress, completed, canceled)
- [x] Display the list of tasks in a table or list view (I have attached a JSON list that you can import/write to and read from.)
- [x] Implement functionality to edit and delete tasks.
- [x] Implement functionality to assign tasks to other users 
- [x] Style the application using Material UI components.
- [] Storage can be done in memory where a list can be maintained within the state or the application/dashboard/main page. 
- [x] Implement any additional features or improvements you think would enhance the todo list application.

Bonus (optional):

- [x] Implement data persistence using a backend or local storage.
- [x] Implement sorting and filtering options for the task list.
- [] Add unit tests using a testing framework like Jest or React Testing Library.
