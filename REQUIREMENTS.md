### Requirements:

- [x] Create a React application using Create React App/NextJS.

- [x] Display the list of tasks in a table or list view (I have attached a JSON list that you can import/write to and read from.)
- [] Implement functionality to edit and delete tasks.
- [] Implement functionality to assign tasks to other users 
- [x] Style the application using Material UI components.
